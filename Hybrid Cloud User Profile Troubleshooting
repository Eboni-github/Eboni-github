                    Overview
In a hybrid cloud environment, user profiles can sometimes become corrupted or misconfigured, leading to 
application malfunctions. This document outlines the procedure for deleting and rebuilding a user profile within such 
an environment. By performing a controlled deletion and rebuild, we can resolve application issues stemming from 
corrupted profiles and restore the user's environment to a functional state.

Guided Steps
1. Access the user’s Drive (if applicable) to create a folder and back up any critical documents and files. Consider if your org has enabled roaming profile

2. Log out the existing user.

3. Using your credentials, log into the system with your administrator credentials.

4. In the search bar, type “Run” to access the Run dialog box and type “systempropertiesadvanced” to access the 
system properties window

5. Under the “Advanced” click the “Settings” button within the ‘User Profiles’ section. 

6. Locate the user profile you intend to delete and click “Yes” in the confirmation window.

7. Once the user profile is deleted, have the user sign back in using their existing credentials to rebuild their 
profile and verify if the applications are functioning as expected
