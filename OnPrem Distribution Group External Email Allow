                    Overview
Distribution groups are used to consolidate groups of recipients into a single point of contact 
for email messages. Use cases for distribution lists can serve a variety of purposes such as, sending 
announcements to a large group of people or communicating with a team or project group. We have 
a Hybrid environment, so distribution groups are managed on-premises and in the cloud. in Active 
Directory Domain Services (AD DS). 

By default, on-premises distribution groups only allow internal users to send emails to the 
group. To allow external users to send emails to the group, change the distribution group 
‘MsExchRequireAuthTo’ attribute in AD DS from ‘True’ to ‘False’. When the attribute is set to ‘True’, 
only internal users can send emails to the group. When this attribute is set to ‘False’, anyone can 
send emails to this group. Therefore, allowing external users to send emails to your on-premises 
distribution groups which also can increase the risk of spam, phishing, and malware attacks.
