                  Overview
This document outlines the steps to troubleshoot and resolve issues with Zoho installation (for example) when encountering conflicts 
within the Windows registry. The solution involves removing a specific registry key and reinstalling Zoho through the 
Company Portal.
                                                                                            
This approach ensures a clean installation environment for Zoho, eliminating potential interference from previous 
installations or registry modifications.
                                                                                            
Resolution Steps
      1. Run Registry Editor (Regedit) as Administrator.
                                                                                            
      2. Save a Backup of the Current Registry 
        a. Navigate to File > Export within the registry editor
        b. Enter a descriptive name for the backup file and choose a safe location to save it
                                                                                            
      3. Using the tree structure on the left pane, carefully navigate to and delete the Zoho Assist folder within the 
      registry editor. 
        a. HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE > Zoho Assist
                                                                                            
      4. Close the registry editor and restart your device to allow changes to take effect.
                                                                                            
      5. Open the Company Portal application on the device
        a. If Zoho is already listed as “Installed”, select “(retry) Uninstall”
        b. In some cases, Zoho may need to be uninstalled manually through “Programs & Features” or “Apps & 
        Features”
                                                                                            
      6. Reinstall Zoho
                                                                                            
Security & Compliance Concerns
                                                                                            
Modifying the registry carries inherent risks like accidental deletion, but
creating a backup beforehand (Step 2) minimizes these risks by allowing 
restoration if needed.
