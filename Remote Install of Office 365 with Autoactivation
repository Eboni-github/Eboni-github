                            Overview
This document outlines a procedure to remotely install Visio (or Publisher) on user devices. This approach leverages pre-configured 
installation files (setup.exe and configuration XML) stored on a centralized server. Through a secure remote 
connection,you can efficiently deploy Visio while ensuring consistent configuration across user environments.

This guide details the step-by-step process, including:
    • Executing a PowerShell script with administrator privileges to initiate the installation using the configuration 
    file.

By following these steps, technicians can deliver streamlined and secure Visio (or Publisher) deployments on user devices.

Pre-Deployment Steps:
  1. Verify File Placement: Ensure the setup.exe installer and configuration-Office365-x64.xml file is present in the 
  desired path.
  a. Create a new Folder on the user’s Desktop named ‘Office’ and place a COPY of the setup.exe installer
  and configuration xml file in the folder (you can leave it on the server, but be sure to reference accordingly)
  
  2. Close Conflicting Applications: Advise the user to save and close any open Office application before proceeding 
  to minimize interruptions or conflicts during the installation process.

Deployment Process:
  3. Launch PowerShell or PowerShell ISE as Administrator: On the user’s device, locate and launch the PowerShell 
  Integrated Scripting Environment (ISE) with administrator privileges.
  
  4. Navigate to User Desktop Directory: Within the PowerShell console, utilize the cd (change directory) command 
  to change the working directory to the user’s desktop or where the installation files reside. 
        Here’s the syntax:
        a. cd [path to folder]

  5. Initiate Installation with Configuration: Execute the following command to begin the Visio installation process 
  while referencing the configuration file: 

      a. .\setup.exe /configure .\(name of XML file)

   6. Monitor Installation Progress: Following the execution of the command, the Visio installation process will 
  commence. You can monitor the progress through the on-screen prompts.

Post-Installation Tasks:
7. Activation: Once the installation is complete, verify with the user if Visio requires activation by opening the 
application. 
      a. Automatic Activation via Configuration File: The configuration-Office365-x64.xml file is configured to 
      include the product key. The user should not be prompted to enter a key during the installation process. 
      Visio should activate automatically upon successful installation.

      Here's the XML syntax to ensure automatic activation: 

<Configuration>

  <Add OfficeClientEdition="64" Channel="Current">
    <Product ID="[Pick the Correct Product ID" PIDKEY="[Insert the Activation Key Here in #####-#####-#####">
      <Language ID="en-us" />
    </Product>
  </Add>

  <!--  <Updates Enabled="TRUE" Channel="Current" />  -->

  <!--  <Display Level="None" AcceptEULA="TRUE" />  -->

  <!--  <Property Name="AUTOACTIVATE" Value="1" />  -->

</Configuration>
    

9. Optional Restart: While a restart is typically not required after successful installation, you can recommend the 
user reboot their device if they encounter any unexpected behaviors.
